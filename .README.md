using template after failed attempts Ive gained the knowledge through
resarch and study how to use struct and allocate space without leaking
memory with only helper functions.
using pointers and dereferencing them in very resource heavy but im not
familiar with the entire scope of their massive usage.
for me this project is something im not prepared for but i jump right
in because theres no other way to do it!
